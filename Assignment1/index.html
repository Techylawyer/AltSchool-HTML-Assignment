            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Grace Oluwasegun, with AltSchool ID ALT/SOE/024/1794. I am a lawyer, having being
                called to the Nigerian bar in 2017, and I have over five years' experience working in the legal tech
                space.

            <h2> Why AltSchool Africa?</h2>
            <p>In 2019, Tech found me after I accepted an offer to join a legal tech startup as an analyst. After a
                while, I became dissatisfied with my 9-5 and I decided to take a deep dive into the world of tech.</p>
            <p>I started off with learning product management. After a 3-week bootcamp in product management, I knew
                there was more and I began seeking more knowledge. One of the product management tutors emphasized that
                technical knowledge is required to become an excellent product manager.</p>
            <p>My desire to be excellent at anything I do fuelled my signing up on FreeCodeCamp to learn the basics of
                web development. However, after I few lessons, I was hooked. I continued learning web development and
                joined bootcamps along the way in my quest to becoming a world-class frontend engineer.</p>
            <p>These resources, as great as they were, did not succeed in making me the kind of engineer I envisioned
                for
                myself. After reading reviews of AltSchool online, I decided, why not? And here I am.</p>

            <h2>My AltSchool Africa Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal for the AltSchool program is simpleâ€“soak up all the knowledge required to become a world-class
                software engineer. I am determined to commit to radical, disciplined and dedicated self-development,
                while taking advantage of the AltSchool community, especially my learning circle.</p>
